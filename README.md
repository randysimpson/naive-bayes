# Naive-Bayes

This application was created to use the Naive-Bayes algorithm for analyzing text.  First send sanitized text into the build api call, then the predict and the entropy methods can be used to perform processing on the text.  Additional text can be sent into the build function later to also be placed into the model.  This model is ephemeral and will not retain after the application closes or crashes.

## Build Model

The `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/build` api method will build the model to be used in language processing.  The payload must be type `application/json` and in the form of:

```json
{
  "status": "Success",
  "size": 4,
  "data": "This is a test",
}
```

### From File

This example is using an output file from the sanitize-text app.

```sh
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @output.txt -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/build
```

## Predict

To get the probabilities of the next word of `this` we use:

```sh
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/predict/this
```

Use url encoding if we want to find `<error>`:

```sh
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/v1/predict/%3Cerror%3E
```

## Entropy

check completely different data

```sh
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data":"Somthing is very wrong here"}' -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/entropy
```

check from sanitized output:

```sh
cat output2.curl | jq -r '.data' | sed -e 's/<\/line> /<\/line>\n/g' | while read LINE ; do echo '{"data":"'$LINE'"}';  done | while read LINE ; do echo 'curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '"'"''$LINE''"'"' -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/entropy';  done
```

## Installation

This is a microservice which has been written based on REST-API to allow for deployment from a docker container.

### Manual Build

To manually build the source files you will need to get the external dependencies and then build the binary executable file.

```
go get k8s.io/klog
go get github.com/gorilla/mux
go build
```
